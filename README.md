# ARIVe-public
 Repository for code supporting the project focused on the association between patient race/ethnicity and invasive ventilation

This repository has two folders:

1) BigQueryScripts. This contains the scripts used to build the cohorts from MIMIC-IV and eICU databases.
2) Rscripts. This contains the scripts used to combine the two cohorts, fit the model, perform the mediation analysis, and generate the results including tables and figures.

Happy to field any questions or provide assistance where I can. This is provided in the spirit of transparency and reproducibility, but I acknowledge that my own programming skills and experience may make those tasks more not less difficult.
